    @brief Handler of the URC "+CMQTTRXSTART".

    @details This object is responsible of detecting, parsing and storing 
        incoming MQTT messages sent to the device. It has one important 
        member, "messageQueue", i.e. a CircularBuffer object used to store 
        incoming messages if they arrive at a high rate. The size of this
        buffer is define by the variable MQTT_MESSAGE_QUEUE_SIZE. If messages
        arrive at a faster rate than they are read, older messages are dropped.
        The maximum length of the topic and payload of MQTT messages shored in 
        this queue if defined by the variables MQTT_TOPIC_BUFFER_LEN and 
        MQTT_PAYLOAD_BUFFER_LEN, respectively.

        This event does not produces a A76XXURC_t URC code when A76XX::listen
        is called.
